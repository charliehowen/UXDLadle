                            <h1><b>Build-A-Budget</b></h1>
                            <p><i>Build-A-Budget</i> is a budgeting app for young adults. Our goal is to get young adults to establish habits early in their personal finance.</p>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Based on a survey we sent near the beginning of the semester, students aren’t generally confident in their budgeting skills. Some used an existing budgeting tool, like Mint, but those who did often found it difficult to maintain, customize, or influence long-term spending habits. Some particular complaints were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><b>Technology makes it harder to save money</b></p>
                                    <p>Today’s technology makes money more intangible and easier to overspend.</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Existing solutions have too much information</b></p>
                                    <p>Budgeting apps have information they do not need or understand, like a section for incorporating a mortgage in your budget.</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Existing solutions little customizability</b></p>
                                    <p>Budgeting apps have features or functionality, like a large number of specific categories, that aren’t useful but can’t be removed.</p></li>
                                <li><p><b>Existing solutions require a lot of maintenance</b></p>
                                    <p>Some budgeting apps offer automated categorization functionality that is incorrect or not useful, and require a lot of user maintenance to correct.</p></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>One major theme from interviews and the survey that we wanted to focus on involved reactive versus proactive budgeting. Existing systems tend to use the former; an app might record your purchasing, generate a graph for the month, and show you where you spend too much. A proactive system, alternatively, would actively influence your future spending based on historic patterns, budget recommendations, or user-specified goals. These, we reason, would be more likely to actually change a user’s spending patterns and teach them how to budget effectively.</p>

                            <h3>Our User's Needs</h3>
                            <p>Throughout this phase, we have been guided and informed by the unique qualities of our user group. On the whole, we assumed and validated that majority of young adults are easily accessible, proactive and relatively open minded to trying alternative design features. They are accustomed to a clearly defined, minimalist aesthetic and have an experiential knowledge of affordances that allow many design features to become implicit and streamlined.</p>
                            <p>Based on the experiences of our team and responses to our budgeting survey, we were able to identify specific needs for young people dealing with finances:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><b><i>Quick and/or automated</i></b></p>
                                    <p>For a demographic that only spends a couple hours a week on financial matters (youngadultmoney.com), it’s important that our product takes as little time to use and maintain as possible. It should leverage automated systems where possible, and streamline any user interaction where not.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p><b><i>Simple, intuitive display of information</i></b></p>
                                    <p>In our budgeting survey, we received multiple responses along the lines of “finances are complicated” or “I just don’t want to think about it.” If we are going to deliver financial information to a group of people who have little experience in finances, we have to be careful to sidestep information aversion by delivering budgeting information in simple, bite-sized chunks.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p><b><i>Customizable</i></b></p>
                                    <p>In our research on existing applications as well as in user interviews, we found that budgeting apps are customizable, but only from a template. For example, an application may already have a set of categories with automatic categorization, but the user has to retroactively go back and delete categories and categorize themselves.  We want to make our app customizable from the ground-up.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Why <i>Build-A-Budget</i> meets User Needs</h3>
                            <p>During the needs analysis phase, we identified several problems that our targeted user group faces. To that end, <i>Build-A-Budget</i> has put these qualities front and center, actively catering to young adults’ preferences. Our design, both visually and informationally, contains no extraneous clutter. Most data can be accessed if desired, but things like transactions are not placed on the main page to distract from the central display. Notification frequency is optimized for impact, with only one or two appearing daily. Our categorization process is efficient and minimal, needing only a single action to sort a purchase and select whether it will always be categorized as such. Specific design attributes that highlight our value and support our user’s needs include:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <b><li>Tailored Budget Values</li></b>
                                    <p><i>Build-A-Budget</i> collects personal data including age and location and offers customized budget plans that users can modify at any time. These easy-to-implement plans will be built on crowdsourced data from our user group and external data sets. By suggesting how much young adults should be spending based on demographics, young adults will develop more realistic and accurate budget plans.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align:center">
                                    <img alt="centered image" src='img/final_1.png'>    
                                    </p>
                                
                                <b><li>Proactive Goals</li></b>
                                    <p>Based on our user interviews, we found that the value of a budgeting app comes from the insights it provides in future purchasing decisions. For this to be effective, users have to consistently interact with the app to receive feedback and check behavior. To encourage this, <i>Build-A-Budget</i>  sends reminders for uncategorized transactions and goals via push notification. From inspirational design study, we realized that many budgeting apps lack this feature of notifications. In testing, users said that <i>Build-A-Budget</i> notifications would allow them to engage more intentionally and actively.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align:center">
                                    <img alt="centered image" src='img/final_2.png'>    
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <b><li>Rapid Categorization</li></b>
                                    <p>To minimize annoying tasks, <i>Build-A-Budget</i> offers a simplified action to categorize unknown purchases. Comparable apps in this space have automated categorization that is often inaccurate. During user interviews and in heuristic feedback, many users addressed that such design caused them to constantly edit or ignore categories. To get accurate data with minimal overhead, our app utilizes a drag and drop action which takes less than half a second to complete. If an item is categorized once, it will ask the user if they always want to categorize it this way, and then act accordingly. Users always have the option to add new categories, exclude a purchase from categories altogether, or edit a chosen category later. This maximizes customizability while optimizing for simplicity. The following images show this feature over time with the final design on the right.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align:center">
                                    <img alt="centered image" src='img/final_5.png'>    
                                    </p>
                                </ul>

                            <p>While these features took a majority of our effort this semester, to our users, they are minimum conditions that must be met to justify engagement. Because young adults sort through such a high volume of content, they have become adept at filtering by these values and immediately discarding options that don’t achieve them. While many apps make this look effortless, in our UX process -- where we started out with nothing --  our team found that the implementation was not as easy as it appeared at the outset. We learned a lot and have put an incredible amount of intention into our current design. We admit there is an element of novelty missing in the result, but we argue that no amount of novelty could subvert a poorly designed foundation, which is why we emphasized some direct concerns of our users. As mentioned above, these are: quick, simple & intuitive, and customizable.  We feel that <i>Build-A-Budget</i> effectively addresses each of these needs.</p>

                            <h3>Our Goals and How We Met Them</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <b><li>Complete a fully clickable prototype with animations that accurately represented our application.</li></b>
                                <p>We decided to not do any app development and rather focused on the design details in our clickable prototype.  We made sure every element was included, and that everything fit together as a design.</p>
                                <b><li>Explore the details of interaction design to make our app as simple, yet elegant, as possible.</li></b>
                                <p>We spent a lot of time thinking about different interactions with our prototype. We used Adobe XD to create the transitions between each screen. Along the way, we also discovered new features that XD offered in terms of animations.</p>
                                <b><li>Develop something that helps young adults be more proactive about adulting.</li></b>
                                <p>We did our best to make <i>Build-A-Budget</i> more proactive with its goals and notifications. It includes notifications on goals, budget status, and uncategorized purchases.</p>
                                <b><li>Accomplish our personal learning goals</li></b>

However, we spent a lot of time discussing and sketching our app together as a team and discussing the pros/cons of each idea.</p>
                            </p>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Tradeoffs and Why We Made Them</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <b><li>Design vs. functionality</li></b>
                            <p>One of our biggest decisions during the last phase was to omit more advanced functionality to focus on the design. The only way for us to include more functionality was to switch platforms and move into actual app development. We decided that focusing on design would be more beneficial for the project because it showed where the functionality would go but could stand alone. For example, in the section where a user would chose and add a bank to their account, we just left a placeholder because this stage of the design does not see much benefit from having functioning logic for picking a bank.</p>
                            <b><li>Level of detail</li></b>
                            <p>Our app is designed for young adults so we decided to keep the written details relevant and minimal. While some budgeting apps contain both descriptive text and advanced functionality for topics that we believe young adults will not need. We decided to focus on the core functionality, proactive budgeting, custom categorization, and user goals. Text and functionality revolving around mortgages, for example, was left out.</p>

                                <img alt="centered image" src='img/final_6.png'>    
                            </p>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Alternative designs</h3>
                        <p>We had several changes to our design after the heuristic evaluation, our usability study, and teaching team feedback. We made changes in response to heuristic evaluation during the last phase, not this phase, and you can see our response in <a href="design_refinement.html">Design Refinement -> Phase report</a>
