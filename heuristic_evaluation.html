                                    <li><b>[6 Recognition Rather than Recall] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b> How does a user add budgets to the ones already shown on the Home screen? Right now, there’s no apparent button to do this and I was unable to find a way. This implies that there would be a route, but that the user would need to go through a series of complex clicks to find it.</li>
                                    <li><b>[Heuristic 10,  Help and documentation] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> Not sure how to edit my money intake and such from the home screen. How do I add transactions?</li>

                                    <li><b>[2 Match between system and the real world] (Severity 0) [1 of us]</b> Realistically, what would the app link to in order to find “Total Assets”? Would this be a value given by the user? Linked to a bank account?</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b> Mapping problem: in the initial create a budget screen, if the user clicks “Food”, it leads to a page that only has the button “Food.” Clicking this button leads back to the create your budget page.</li>
                                    <li><b>[9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors] (Severity 2) [2 of us]</b> On the above “Food” screen, there should be a back button in case I as a user didn’t mean to select it.</li>
                                    <li><b>[9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b> If user selects “+Other” in categories, there’s no back button to escape if this was a mistake. It appears that the user must add a category.</li>
                                    <li><b>[9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b> The back button on “Set budget values” brings user all the way back to the first create a budget screen. This may cause issues if someone just wants to add a category they forgot on the page before.</li>
                                    <li><b>[9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors] (Severity 0) [1 of us]</b> In “Set budget values”, if you click on a value field and don’t mean to type anything, there is only a check button. As long as it doesn’t refresh every time, this may not be a problem.</li>
                                    <li><b>[8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design] (Severity 0) [1 of us]</b> The see average feature is interesting, but it might be better to have lower down where it appears more as an extra thing than something needed for actual functionality. This could also maybe take the form of a question mark button rather than a check mark (which are used as a narrative tool for pushing the user further through the app).</li>
                                    <li><b>[8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design] (Severity 1) [1 of us]</b> The 3 horizontal bars menu doesn’t need to have a Home callout on the Home screen- theoretically the user should only need to click out of the dialogue box. Alternatively, color the button to show what screen the user is already on.</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 4) [1 of us]</b> Huge mapping problem: clicking outside of the 3 horizontal bar dialogue screen always redirects to the “Goal 1” page. It should instead bring the user back to the original page sans callout. Note: This was an issue on the Sympli website and may not be present on other platforms.</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) [3 of us]</b> Missing button functionality: in 3 horizontal box dialogue box, should Goals go to a goal page and settings to a Settings page? Both currently go to the Income/Savings/Debt page (which is definitely not right).</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b> On %Income/%Savings/%Debt page, user can click on the % in income to change it to $, but can’t switch back by clicking the new $ icon or the back button.</li>
                                    <li><b>[2 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b>On the Income details screen, it’s unclear if I can still switch to % on that page</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 0)  [1 of us]</b>Clicking dollar amount on $Income/%Savings/%Debt screen leads to Goals for the income screen. Hitting back brings the user back to the %Income/%Savings/%Debt screen instead of $Income/%Savings/%Debt screen. Note: Also an issue on the Sympli app.</li>
                                    <li><b>[6 Recognition rather than recall] (Severity 3) [3 of us] </b>Only one way to get to the income details page with the goals for the income.</li>
                                    <li><b>[1 Visibility of system status] (Severity 1) [2 of us] </b>Under goals on the Home Screen, what is hitting “Done” on the goals supposed to do? This brings out a dialogue screen with other goals, but says nothing confirming that the user has completed a goal.</li>
                                    <li><b>[7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 4) [1 of us]</b> Uncategorized purchases should open up into a screen with a list of existing but uncategorized charges that the user can pick themselves to assign to one of the categories. Current implication is that the user has to go through and categorize each individual one in the order they are currently sitting in the queue.</li>
                                    <li><b>[1 Visibility of system status] (Severity 1) [1 of us]</b>There is no indication after the user has categorized a purchase that the interaction was successful. A new dialogue box stating the user’s choices and letting them know that their changes have been made would be useful. (On Sympli platform)
                                    <li><b>[7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 1) [1 of us] </b>User needs to click on the charge already in the center of the categorization screen before clicking on one of the categories- it’s already implied that the object in the center is the one the user is interested in (unless the center can be easily changed by clicking on it to a different charge). As is, this is slow and inefficient.</li>
                                    <li><b>[9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors/Consistency and Standards] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> Conoco>Car should maybe have both circles colored and a checkmark screen- goes to a screen with nothing in it and does not show how to get out. Back button from this screen leads all the way back to the home page, not to the Conoco categorization menu. (From Sympli)</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 4) [2 of us]</b> The back button consistently has problems linking directly to the previous screen.</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards/Aesthetic and Minimalist Design/Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 1) [2 of us]</b> The 3 horizontal bar screen is one that I might expect to be present on every screen of my app as a user. It should be implemented on all of the pages, not just the home page.</li>
                                    <li><b>[7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 0) [2 of us]</b> Is add goal going to be a button? If so, where will it be? As a user, I might expect to find it by clicking on the Goals button from the 3 horizontal bar menu. It might be useful to have a pencil/edit icon on the Goals section in the home screen so users can directly add or edit their goals from there.</li>
                                    <li><b>[7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 0)  [1 of us]</b> A “See All” button for recent purchases would be good to have on the home screen. It wouldn’t hurt to have more than one way to navigate to the list of purchases.</li>
                                    <li><b>[7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 1) [2 of us]</b> In Purchases page, it would be good to have an option to recategorize a purchase directly from that list when a user clicks on it. Again, having multiple routes to get to the same functionality reduces how much the user needs to think about exact interactions to get somewhere in the app.</li>
                                    <li><b>[6 Recognition Rather than Recall] (Severity 1) [1 of us] </b>In “See Average for __ year old” categories disappear and only show the dollar values. There should be a dialogue at the top explaining what is being seen and a label on each of the values so the user doesn’t need to memorize the list before clicking on the feature.</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 1) [2 of us]</b> In “See Average for __ year old” the check mark doesn’t make sense to me as a user- will this apply these values to my budget? Instead, I’d have this as a pop-out dialogue box with a title “Average Budget for __ Year Old,” an X in one of the corners, and the ability to just click on the screen behind it to close it.</li>
                                    <li><b>[7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 1) [1 of us]</b> Add functionality to apply the average age budget values to the budget being created. I might expect to click on this as a user (especially as a first-time budgeter) to get a starting set of values to work off of.</li>
                                    <li><b>[Heuristic 10,  Help and documentation] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> Something to tell me I downloaded the right app on the login screen. Like a “this is a moving app” logo or name or something</li>
                                    <li><b>[Heuristic 4, Consistency and standards] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> Some buttons highlight when hovered or clicked on, but not all of the buttons have this</li>
                                    <li><b> [Heuristic 8,  Aesthetic and minimalist design] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b> Yellow Color is hard to read on the recent transactions page</li>
                                    <li><b>[Heuristic 4, Consistency and standards] (Severity 1) [1 of us]</b> Yellow check button on the goals page is confusing. Am I “Ok-ing” the goals?</li>
                                    <li><b>[Heuristic 4, Consistency and standards] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> The colors in the circle chart on the home page make me want to interact and click on the circle.</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b> More and +Other buttons on the category screen are the same as normal categories, so they aren’t easily discoverable</li>
                                    <li><b>[7 Flexibility and Ease of Use] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b>  Enter value box pops up over the values for all the categories, so you can’t enter values relative to those you’ve already entered</li>
                                    <li><b>[4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) [1 of us]</b>Check mark for the “see average” is the same as the go forward a step check, which makes it unclear that you can then hide the values again.</li>
                                    <li><b>[9 Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> When you have goals on the budget screen, they both go away after you hit done on 1. And if you didn’t actually mean to dismiss both goals, you run into problems with the back button (see below)</li>
                                    <li><b>[9 Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors]</b> (Severity 3) [1 of us] Hitting back on the “Set budget values” page invariably takes you back to “Create your budget” instead of back to what you were last looking at</li>
                                    <li><b>[1 Visibility of System Status] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> It’s unclear why I’m on the “Set budget values” page with both goals visible after hitting done on an individual goal.</li>
                                    <li><b>[2 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 3) [1 of us]</b> “Done” takes me to more details when I push it on the home page, and removes details (the goals) on the next</li>
                                    <li><b>[2 Consistency and Standards] (Severity 1) [1 of us]</b> The icon that is always used as back is used, flipped, as more details about a goal on the income details screen</li>
